            <h1>Iron Man</h1>
            <p>
                A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark
                suffers a
                severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of
                mass
                destruction, he instead creates a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity.
                Later,
                Stark
                develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company,
                Stark
                Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at
                first
                concealing his true identity, Stark eventually declared that he was, in fact, Iron Man in a public
                announcement.
                Iron Man possesses powered armor that gives him superhuman strength and durability, flight, and an
                array
                of
                weapons. The armor is invented and worn by Stark.

            <h1>Hulk</h1>
            <p>
                The character is both the Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a vast degree
                of
                physical strength, and his alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and
                emotionally reserved physicist, the two existing as independent personalities and resenting of the
                other.
                Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is
                physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will, often
                leading
                to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level of
                strength
                is
                normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the
                Hulk
                has
                been represented with other personalities based on Banner's fractured psyche, from a mindless,
                destructive
                force, to a brilliant warrior, or genius scientist in his own right.

            <h1>Captain America</h1>
            <p>
                Captain America wears a costume bearing an American flag motif, and he utilizes a nearly indestructible
                shield
                which he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young man
                enhanced to
                the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the United States government's efforts in
                World
                War
                II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was
                revived
                in
                the present day. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his
                time
                with
                its modern realities, he remains a highly respected figure in his community which includes becoming the
                long-time leader of the Avengers.

            <h1>Thor</h1>
            <p>
                Like all Asgardians, Thor is incredibly long-lived and relies upon periodic consumption of the Golden
                Apples
                of
                Idunn to sustain his extended lifespan, which to date has lasted many millennia. Being the son of Odin
                and
                the
                elder goddess Gaea, Thor is physically the strongest of the Asgardians. Thor is capable of incredible
                feats
                of
                strength, such as lifting the almost Earth-sized Midgard Serpent, supporting a
                weight equivalent to that of 20 planets, and by combining his power with that of Beta Ray Bill,
                destroying
                Surtur's solar system-sized dimensional portal. If pressed in battle, Thor is capable of entering into a
                state known as the "Warrior's Madness" ("berserkergang" in Norwegian and Danish alike), which will
                temporarily
                increase his strength and stamina tenfold, although in this state he attacks friend and foe alike.

            <h1>Black Widow</h1>
            <p>
                The Black Widow has been enhanced by biotechnology that makes her body resistant to aging and disease
                and
                heals
                above the human rate; as well as psychological conditioning that suppresses her memory of true events as
                opposed to implanted ones of the past without the aid of specially designed system suppressant drugs.The
                white
                blood cells in her body are efficient enough to fight off any microbe, foreign body and others from
                her body, keeping her healthy and immune to most, if not all infections, diseases and disorders.Her
                agility
                is
                greater than that of an Olympic gold medalist. She can coordinate her body with balance,
                flexibility, and dexterity easily.Romanova has a gifted intellect. She displays an uncanny affinity for
                psychological manipulation and can
                mask her real emotions perfectly. Like Steve Rogers, she possesses the ability to quickly process
                multiple
                information streams (such as threat assessment) and rapidly respond to changing tactical situations.

            <h1>Clint Barton</h1>
            <p>
                Clinton Francis "Clint" Barton, also known as Hawkeye, is a skilled marksman, a former special agent of
                S.H.I.E.L.D. and one of the founding members of the Avengers. Known for his use of the bow and arrow as
                his
                primary weapon, Barton had become one of the best agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., responsible for the
                recruitment of
                Black Widow, whom he developed a strong friendship with. Assigned by Nick Fury into watching over the
                Tesseract,
                he was brainwashed by Loki and used as a pawn for all his evil schemes. However, following their Attack
                on
                the
                Helicarrier, he was freed from Loki's mental control by Black Widow and joined the Avengers to fight
                against
                Loki's Chitauri army in the Battle of New York, ending Loki's Invasion before Hawkeye had returned to
                his
                work
                as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
